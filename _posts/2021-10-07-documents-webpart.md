The [DattaTable Library](https://datta-framework.github.io/dattatable) has a new [Documents](https://datta-framework.github.io/dattatable/classes/Documents.html) component that will allow you to easily interact with a document library. This modern look will work in SharePoint 2013 environments, so you are able to create modern solutions in classic environments.

A [code walkthrough](https://github.com/datta-framework/documents-wp/wiki) is available to walk you through creating an example of this component.
